<h3> The Zone of Interest</h3>
<P>A great artist can offer a radical new perspective on a well-trodden subject. So it is with Jonathan Glazer's Holocaust masterpiece, which takes Hannah Arendt's phrase "the banality of evil" and shows us what banal evil really looks like. The family life of Auschwitz camp commandant Rudolf Höss (Christian Friedel) and his wife (Sandra Hüller) is a vision of cursed domesticity. The horrors remain out of sight but, crucially, not out of earshot. Sound designer Johnnie Burn's soundscape has the yelling of guards and the crack of rifle shots punctuating scenes of gardening and kids playing. The result is a Come and See for the 2020s.

    <h3>Poor Things</h3>
        <p>Sensual coming-of-age journey on helium or problematic story of sexual exploitation? The conversation came late to Yorgos Lanthimos's singular adaptation of Scottish writer Alasdair Gray's cult 1992 novel, but it came pretty hard. And yet, with Dogtooth, The Lobster and The Favourite behind him, the Greek is a master of creating lopsided, not-for-everyone visions of the human experience and this Victorian Frankenstein riff, in which a magnet Emma Stone plays a lustier-than-normal version of the monster, is no exception. Surely the most bonkers film to score 11 Oscars nominations.

                <h3>Dune: Part Two</h3> 
                <p>Does Denis Villeneuve ever miss? He's certainly hitting close to .400 when it comes to blockbuster movie making and his first proper sequel keeps that hot streak alive. Having done the heavy lifting of reimagining Frank Herbert's sci-fi epic in the first Dune, Part Two adds moral complexity and giant desert battles to the world building and galactic scheming. But even the ludicrously starry cast can't compete with those monstrous sandworms giant Tube trains careering through the sandy substrata of Arrakis that give this inspiring movie its most awesome motif.
